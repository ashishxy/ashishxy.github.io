<p> <h3>how to learn stuff in a time where attention spans are horrible?</h3></p>
<p>1.avoid distractions. use the smartphone as if it is your servant, do not let it become your master.</p>
  <p>2. too much information is not always helpful. you do not necessarily need 5 tutorials, instead you need 5 ways to think about it. sit with the problem.</p>
	<p>3. take the information you just consumed and write it down in your own words. figure out what you do not understand yet. </p>
	<p>4. try to share it with your friends. try to explain it to them. explaining will reveal holes in your understanding which you never knew existed. </p>
